- About this project

This Open Source hobby project was first started by Master Chief, then taken over by DHP/RevoGirl (Samantha â€ ) and is now maintained by Pike R. Alpha (http://pikeralpha.wordpress.com). A long time supporter of the RevoBoot project.


- Server.app

RevoBoot works with the Server app for Mountain Lion (12C60) and Mavericks.


- Fusion Drive Support


Apple's Fusion Drive* is a software implementation to speedup the boot and load process for frequently used applications, without limiting the storage capacity in a bad way. See also: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5446

The new Mac's that come with a Fusion Drive, boot from the third (Recovery HD like) partition on the SSD. This partition is 134.2 MB in size and is called "Boot OS X". The Recovery HD partition can be found as third partition on the HDD. RevoBoot detects CoreStorage partitions and will boot from the boot helper partition on the SDD.


- NetBoot/NetInstall

People who have Mountain Lion Server setup and like to install their hack from it... sorry that won't work. The source 
code snippets for it have been stripped out (by Master Chief in 2009). 


- Xcode Support for Mountain Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite

RevoBoot can be built on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion. The latter requires Xcode 4.5.1 (and greater) and the latest 'command line tools' need to be installed. See change log for instructions.


- Configuration

Please note that RevoBoot must be configured for your hardware specifically. This makes it on of, if not the most difficult boot loader to setup, but that's just what you have to do. And sorry, but don't expect any help from me, because I don't have the time for it.
